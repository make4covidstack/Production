# Make4Covid Production Files

This is the primary repository for all of the production-approved files
for Make4Covid.  All of the items and methods as described in this repository
are specifically approved by the hospitals and medical professionals in our area.

*We ask that makers only produce what is asked for due to the coordination
that is in place with the medical facilities and other production 
currently in process.*

Each type of part we are looking to produce is each in it's own directory:
