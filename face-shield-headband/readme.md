# Make4Covid Face Shield Headbands

These are the primary product at this time.
These are the primary supports for the face shields and the current biggest need.

Please select what to print from the following guide:

- Is your printer bed smaller than 200x200?  Print the [RC1 band](https://github.com/make4covidstack/Production/face-shield-headband/RC1)
- Can you only print PLA? Print the [RC2 band](https://github.com/make4covidstack/Production/face-shield-headband/RC2)
- Otherwise, please print the [RC3 band](https://github.com/make4covidstack/Production/face-shield-headband/RC3)

Need a starting point?  Check out our [print setting recommendations](https://github.com/make4covidstack/Production/face-shield-headband/settings-recommendations.md)

## Important Notes:
Stacks are coming! While Prusa can do it, it is very hard on printers and we would like to keep people's printers running long-term.
